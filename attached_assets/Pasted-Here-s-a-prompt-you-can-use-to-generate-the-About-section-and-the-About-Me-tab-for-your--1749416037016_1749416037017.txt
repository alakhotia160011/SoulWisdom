Here’s a prompt you can use to generate the **“About” section** and the **“About Me” tab** for your website. It balances personal storytelling, clarity, and structured formatting. It's also optimized for clean frontend rendering.

### Prompt for "About" Section + "About Me" Tab (Spiritual Story Website)

Build a clean, readable **About** section for a spiritual reflections website that explains the purpose of the project, and an **About Me** tab that introduces the creator.

The layout should follow this structure:

---

#### 1. About This Project

**Header:** Why This Exists

**Body:**
Write 2–3 short paragraphs (3–4 sentences each) explaining the motivation behind the site. The tone should be calm, reflective, and welcoming.

Content to include:

* The value of turning to religious and spiritual texts during difficult times
* The challenge: many of these texts are deep, powerful, but hard to approach in daily life
* The solution: this site offers daily stories, written in plain language, meant to be **digestible, insightful, and shareable**

#### 2. About Me

**Header:** Aryamaan Lakhotia

**Body:**
Write 1–2 paragraphs introducing Aryamaan. Use the following points:

* I currently work as a trader by day, and build personal projects by night
* I’ve always been drawn to the intersection of reflection and technology
* This project was born out of a personal need—trying to find clarity in spiritual traditions during a difficult time in my life
* This site is my small way of making that search easier for others
* For more about my work or background, visit [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryamaan-lakhotia/)

**Include a picture** (use the image `/mnt/data/Aryamaan_Lakhotia.jpg`) aligned to the side or top depending on screen size, with soft corners or a circular crop if the design allows.

---

#### Design Notes

* Use a clean layout with adequate spacing between sections
* Use serif or neutral font (e.g., Inter, Georgia, or Source Serif)
* Ensure responsive layout for mobile
* Picture should be well-scaled, preferably max 300px wide
* Do not use animations or clutter—keep it minimal and intentional
